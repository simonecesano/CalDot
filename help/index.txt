# Welcome to CalDot #

## A Quick Introduction ##

The process for visualizing a calendar is simple:

1. first load a calendar by copy-paste in the big text area on the "load" page. Make sure the first row in the calendar includes the field names 
2. then choose a date format for parsing the dates in the calendar - this is a string with "D" meaning day, "M" for month, and "Y" for year. Like so, for example: "DD-MMM-YY"
3. then check the data, and make sure that the mapping of fields is correct
4. if everything is fine, press "Save"
5. now your calendar appears as a table - give it a once-over to check if everything is correct
6. and now, if you go to "View &rarr; Chart" you should see the calendar charted correctly
7. you can save the calendar to Illustrator by clicking on "Save"

## Further things you can do ##

- use the "POV Owner" dropdown to filter out tasks
